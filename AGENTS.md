# AI Agent Guide

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Build & Run

- `npm start` - Start the development server with Vite
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### Code Quality

- `npm run lint` - Run Biome linter (`npx @biomejs/biome lint`)
- `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript type checking (`tsc --noEmit`)
- `npm run lint -- --fix` - Automatically fix linting issues
- `npm run lint -- --fix --unsafe` - Automatically fix unsafe linting issues (do that on a clean git state)

## Architecture Overview

This is a React-based Air Traffic Control (ATC) Controller Working Position (CWP) application that visualizes and controls aircraft in real-time.

### Core Technologies

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **MobX** for state management with observables
- **MapLibre GL** (via react-map-gl) for map rendering
- **MQTT** for real-time communication with simulators
- **Protobuf** for message serialization
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with DaisyUI components
- **Vite** as build tool

### State Management Architecture

The application uses MobX stores instantiated in `src/state.ts`:

- **SimulatorStore**: Manages simulation state and time
- **AircraftStore**: Tracks all aircraft positions, states, and metadata
- **AirspaceStore**: Manages airspace sectors and boundaries
- **ConfigurationStore**: Handles sector configurations and time-based changes
- **CWPStore**: UI state including filters, display options, and selected aircraft
- **RoleConfigurationStore**: Manages user roles and permissions
- **FixStore**: Navigation fixes/waypoints data
- **DistanceLineStore**: Distance measurement tools

### Key Components Structure

- **Map Component** (`src/components/Map.tsx`): Main map view with aircraft, sectors, and overlays
- **Aircraft Components**:
  - `AircraftMarker`: Visual representation on map
  - `AircraftPopup`/`AircraftPopupContent`: Interactive popups for aircraft control
  - `DraggablePopup`: Draggable interface elements
- **Sector Components**: Polygon rendering for airspace sectors
- **Control Panels**: Altitude filters, speed vectors, controller selection modals

### MQTT Communication

The app communicates with an ATC simulator via MQTT:

- Subscribers in `src/mqtt-client/subscribers.ts` handle incoming messages
- Publishers in `src/mqtt-client/publishers.ts` send control commands
- Topics defined in `src/mqtt-client/topics.ts`
- Messages are serialized using Protobuf (see `src/proto/`)

## Code Style Guidelines

- Linting via Biome (config in `biome.json`)
- Use `biome-ignore` comments when necessary with explanations
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Prefer const assertions and explicit types
- Component files use `.tsx`, utilities use `.ts`

## Important Notes

- The protobuf files in `src/proto/` are generated - do not edit manually
- Use absolute imports from `src/` directory
- MobX observables require `observer` wrapper for React components
- Map interactions use MapLibre GL events

## Code Quality and Best Practices

- This project is a prototype used for scientific research in controlled experiments, and it's not intended to be used in real ATC environments.
- We follow best practices for code quality, but we don't over-engineer the solution.
- We adhere to the KISS concept (Keep It Simple, Stupid).
- Overall, the source code should be "good enough".
- However, we do care about high quality code and maintainability. It's about finding the right balance.
- Use the type system effectively, it's helpful. Avoid `any` or `unknown`.
- Prefer composition to inheritance.
- Favour immutability where possible.
- Document the "why".
- Run the linter and type checkers to ensure code quality.
